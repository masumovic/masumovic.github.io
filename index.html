    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Moin! I am Maša Avakumović, a passionate researcher in the field of Applied Mathematics. I hold a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics and am currently a dedicated Ph.D. candidate at the University of Hamburg, specializing in the Department of Mathematics.

    My current research project revolves around the exciting world of climate science. Specifically, I am dedicated to the challenging task of "Modelling and simulating extreme events in the climate system." The study of extreme climate events is of paramount importance in today's world, as it allows us to better understand and prepare for the impacts of climate change.

    Through my research, I aim to shed light on the mechanisms behind extreme weather phenomena, from severe storms to prolonged droughts, and their implications for our planet. My work involves advanced mathematical modeling, simulation techniques, and data analysis to unravel the mysteries of these events.

    I am passionate about the potential of mathematics to solve real-world problems, and I am committed to contributing to the scientific community's understanding of climate extremes. This website serves as a platform to share my research findings, publications, and contact information. Feel free to explore my work and get in touch with me if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities.

    Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you on our journey to uncover the secrets of extreme events in the climate system.</p>
